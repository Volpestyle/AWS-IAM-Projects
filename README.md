# AWS IAM Console Projects
An empty repository which exists to provide context around my work at Amazon Web Services to my portfolio. 

## AWS IAM Console
Utilized AWS's internal UI framework 'Polaris' along with the AWS IAM APIs to implement a specified UX mock for managing IAM entities such as Users. This [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNKPGXYAASANI5sNNY7UIebjXBa3zVtN/view?usp=share_link) shows off some of the basic features implemented. Created in React using Typescript.
